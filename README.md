### Serverless Implementation of Spotify Add song and Playlist feature.

#### Introduction
This repository contains following microservices:

1. A services that adds all of your audio files in an S3 bucket to a DynamoDB

2. A service that allows a user to search for a song(the name of the file) or
returns a list of all of the songs(files) you have in your S3 bucket.

3. A service that allows you to create a new playlist and add a song to that
playlist.

For the purposes of simplicity, I will be making several small txt files
to stand in for MP3s/OGG(other audio files)

#### Usage
*still in progress*
